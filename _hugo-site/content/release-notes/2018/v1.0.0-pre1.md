# Spine 1.0.0-pre1

## Base

This is a pre-release of the `base` library.

#### Changes since version `0.11.0`

This release contains numerous small improvements in the code base, such as:

- `Color` model is improved, as the transparency channel is added to the basic RGB color definition;
- `Money` and utilities for working with money were moved into a separate [repository]({{% get-site-data "spine.money_repo" %}});
- build-time and test-time logging was improved by removing unnecessary build warnings and 
introducing a JUnit extension for muting redundant test output;
- several new convenient APIs added (see `Identifier.generate(Class)`);
- entity IDs are now always validated as if `(required) = true`.

## Core Java
This is a preview release of the Spine 1.0 version.

#### New Maven Repository

In this version one more artifact repository is introduced:

- Releases: [https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/releases](https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/releases)
- Snapshots: [https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/snapshots](https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/snapshots)

The [previously used repository](https://maven.teamdev.com/repository/spine/) is also maintained.

#### Features and Improvements

Since 0.10.0 several significant features were introduced, making the framework near the 
feature completeness:

- Provide automatic idempotency for the business entities.
- Allow to subscribe to the entity state updates.
- Allow to produce a command in response to an event or a command — the `@Command`ing methods.
- Introduce `System` bounded context, which tracks the history of each `Command`, `Event` 
and `Entity`, allowing to trace paths and consequences of incoming end-user imperatives.
- Make `Rejection`s a special kind of `Event`s to simplify thinking for framework users.

For more details on the features please see [#733]({{% get-site-data "spine.core_jvm_repo" %}}/issues/733), 
[#804]({{% get-site-data "spine.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/804) and [#810]({{% get-site-data "spine.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/810) and consult 
the source code.

In addition the framework now uses [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) with a conjunction 
with the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/), which allows to catch the potential 
issues on a compilation stage.

Lots of other less significant improvements were introduced, addressing the issues reported 
from the real-world use-cases.

#### Dependency Updates

- gRPC 1.15.0
- Protobuf 3.6.1
- Protobuf Gradle plugin 0.8.5
- Guava 26.0-jre
- JUnit 5.3.1
