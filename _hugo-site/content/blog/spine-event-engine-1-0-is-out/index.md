We are glad to announce the release of the first production-ready version of Spine Event Engine!

What started as a dream tool concept to help us build event-driven applications, grew and evolved
into a full-fledged CQRS/ES framework for cloud and enterprise.

**In a nutshell:** Spine Event Engine is a framework for building cloud applications and
transforming #EventStorming artifacts into a working domain model code.

**What's in Spine for businesses:**
The framework helps build modern event-driven applications, closely reflecting business reality, in
days not months. It is free for use, however professional consultancy and support are available if
necessary.

**What's in Spine for developers:**
Created with Event Sourcing as a key concept, CQRS as a pattern, and Domain-Driven Design in its
heart, Spine extends the [Protobuf][protobuf] code-generation technology offered by Google for the
needs of the event-driven apps, takes care of the boilerplate code, data flow, and storage, allowing
developers to focus on business logic rather than plumbing.

**What's the proof:**
Honing Spine to work as conceived, we have built several cloud applications on top of it. One of
them, created for the U. S. client, runs commercially since 2017.

**Where do you start:**
Get a general overview of the framework [key concepts][key-concepts] or if you would rather see it
working right away, take a look at the [examples][examples].

**Chime in!**
We answer questions on Spine use in [our Gitter room][gitter-room].
Should you want to join us in improving the framework, see the code in
the [Spine Event Engine organization][spine-github] on GitHub.

**What's next:**
We are currently working on making Spine support more platforms and environments, and extending the
integration with web UI. We will announce the updates [@SpineEngine 𝕏][xtwitter].
