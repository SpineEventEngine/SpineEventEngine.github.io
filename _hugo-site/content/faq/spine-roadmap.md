Here are our plans for the future versions of Spine:

- **PostgreSQL** storage implementation;
- Migrate to **Java 11**;
- **Scaffold** entity classes from Protobuf;
- **Generate Bounded Contexts** using existing Java model definitions.

We shall also concentrate on coverage of popular programming languages
and technologies:

- **Node.js** to enable [Projections](docs/introduction/concepts#projection)
  development by our users creating UI.
- **Dart** client library.
