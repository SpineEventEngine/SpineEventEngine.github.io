Have a look at the [comparison matrix](https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html) 
created by Kenton Varda, the author of Protobuf v2 and Cap'n Proto. Here are the main features 
that make Protobuf the best choice for our framework:

- **Schema evolution** — business models should evolve as the business grows.
- **Usable as mutable state** — for transforming Aggregate States and Stream Projections.
- **Other languages** — for supporting client applications written in JavaScript, JavaNano, Swift,
  Objective-C, and other programming languages.

Also, proven success of Protobuf technology which Google gained over the years of its successful
usage is a major factor for choosing Protobuf rather than other alternatives.
