                        <p>We want to be a framework that provides an infrastructure and connects so to say
                            “service” parts of applications with their “brains” — business logic. Find out how

                    <div class="submenu-content">
                        <p>Because Protocol Buffers are implemented in a variety of languages, they make
                            interoperability between polyglot applications in your architecture that much simpler.
                            If you’re introducing a new service with one in Ruby or Go, or even communicating with a
                            backend written in Node, or Clojure, you simply have to hand the proto file to the code
                            generator written in the target language and you have some nice guarantees about the
                            safety and interoperability between those architectures.
                        </p>

                        <p>The finer points of platform specific data types should be handled for you in the target
                            language implementation, and you can get back to focusing on the hard parts of your
                            problem instead of matching up fields and data types in your ad hoc JSON encoding and
                            decoding schemes.</p>

                    <h6 class="arrow-r">Why Protobuf instead of Cap'n Proto, or SBE, or FlatBuffers?</h6>
                    <div class="submenu-content">
                        <p>Have a look the <a href="https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html" target="_blank">comparison matrix</a>
                            created by Kenton Varda, the author of Protobuf v2 and Cap'n Proto.
                            The main features that make Protobuf best choice for our framework are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Schema evolution</b> — we need this as business models evolve as business grows.</li>
                            <li><b>Usable as mutable state</b> — we need this for transforming Aggregate States and Stream Projections.</li>
                            <li><b>Other languages</b> — we need a support of client applications written on JavaScript, JavaNano, Swift, Objective-C, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also, the experience Google gained through years of using this technology internally is a major factor of preferring Protobuf over alternatives.</p>
