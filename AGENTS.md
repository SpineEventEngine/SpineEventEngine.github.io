# 👋 Welcome, Agents!

## Orientation

If `.agents/project.md` exists in this repository, read it first — it describes
the language, architecture, and role of this specific repo within the Spine SDK
organisation. To create one, copy `.agents/project.template.md` (or the
relevant language template) and fill it in. If `project.md` links to a shared
requirements file (e.g. `jvm-project.md`), read that too.

- Start every session by reading `.agents/quick-reference-card.md` (if present).
- For specific tasks (code review, PR prep, dependency updates, docs, etc.),
  prefer the matching skill from `.agents/skills/`.
- Full standards reference: `.agents/_TOC.md` (if present) — consult when a
  skill doesn't cover the needed context.

## Commit and history safety

**Do not commit, push, tag, rebase, merge, cherry-pick, or otherwise write to git history**
unless one of the following is true *right now*:

1. The currently active skill's `SKILL.md` has a `## Commit authorization` section
   that explicitly permits the operation.
2. The user's *current* prompt explicitly requests the operation.

Authorization does not carry over between turns or sessions. When in doubt: stage
changes, show the diff, and stop — let the user commit.

See [`.agents/safety-rules.md`](.agents/safety-rules.md) → *Commits and history-writing*.

## Other safety rules

- All code must compile and pass static analysis.
- Do not auto-update external dependencies outside a dedicated update task.
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking code.
- No reflection or unsafe code without explicit approval.

See [`.agents/safety-rules.md`](.agents/safety-rules.md) for the full list.

## Moving files

When moving or renaming tracked files, always use `git mv`. Do not simulate a
move by deleting the old file and creating a new one — preserve Git history
unless the user explicitly asks for a fresh replacement.

If `git mv` fails due to permissions or sandbox restrictions, request approval;
do not fall back to delete/create.

## Memory

Team-shared memory lives in `.agents/memory/` (checked into git). Use it for
feedback rules, durable project rationale, and external system pointers.
See `.agents/memory/README.md` for layout and write protocol.

Review `.agents/memory/MEMORY.md` at the start of every session.
Ruthlessly iterate until mistakes stop repeating.

## Verification & Quality

- Never mark a task done without proof (tests, logs, diff vs main).
- Ask: "Would a senior/staff engineer approve this?"
- For non-trivial changes: pause and consider a more elegant solution.
- Fix bugs autonomously — find root cause, no hand-holding, no band-aids.

## Core Principles

- Simplicity first: minimal code impact, minimal surface area.
- No laziness: always find root causes.
- Minimal side effects: avoid new bugs.
- Prefer early returns and clear naming.
- Challenge your own work before presenting it.

## Task planning

- Write plans to `.agents/tasks/<slug>.md` before coding.
  See `.agents/tasks/README.md` for format and lifecycle.
- Verify changes before marking a task done.
- Update memory if lessons emerged.
- Delete the task file on merge to master.
