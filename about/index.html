                    <p class="about-max lead">Spine Event Engine is a framework for building modern cloud applications
                        and aims to free developers from creating boilerplate code as much as possible.
                        Our framework is built on top of <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" target="_blank">
                            Protocol Buffers</a> (a.k.a. protobuf) and
                        <a href="http://www.grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC</a> to bring easiness
                        and efficiency into development of applications with microservice-oriented architecture.</p>

                    <p>The primary language of the backend is Java. Client applications and server-side modules can be
                        written on JavaScript, Java, JavaNano (Android), Swift, Objective-C, C, C++, C#, Go, Python,
                        Ruby, and PHP.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="core-features-title">The main usage scenarios:</h6>
                    <ul class="about-lists">
                        <li><p>Connecting browser clients and mobile devices to backend services.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Maintaining complex and evolving business logic.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Integrating multi-platform and multi-language backend systems.</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="core-features-title">Core Features that make our framework awesome:</h6>
                    <ul class="about-lists">
                        <li><p><b>Code Generation for multiple languages and platforms.</b>
                            Spine makes a domain model language
                            <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html"
                               target="_blank">Ubiquitous</a>
                            not only in people interactions, but in computer communications, too.
                            The model is defined and maintained in Protobuf.
                            Most of the domain model code is automatically generated for all the programming languages
                            of your project.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Strongly Typed Domain&nbsp;Model.</b> Unlike some CQRS/ES frameworks which treat commands
                            and events as Json objects, Spine promotes strong typing of all parts of a business model.
                            The model can be extended without breaking binary compatibility with client applications.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Promoted Immutability.</b> Messages like commands or events, entity state objects,
                            query results, and many other business logic objects being immutable greatly simplify
                            the code since they are automatically thread-safe, and as such are freely shared or
                            referenced.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Isolation of development responsibilities.</b> The framework is based on
                            <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html" target="_blank">CQRS</a> pattern, which
                        allows to develop write- and read- sides of the backend independently.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Easier scaling.</b> Thanks to CQRS pattern, read- and write- sides of the backend
                            can be scaled independently, which reduces maintenance and license costs.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Tracability and debuggability.</b>
                            With <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html" target="_blank">Event Sourcing</a>
                            built into the framework, it is easier to analyze the history of business data evolution,
                            and find causes if something goes wrong.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><p><b>Choice of Storage and Deployment&nbsp;Platforms.</b> The framework promotes writing
                            storage- and platform-agnostic code. You can start with JDBC and later switch
                            to Google Cloud Platform Datastore by changing few lines of code.</p></li>

                        <li><p><b>Easier and Faster Testing.</b> Since the code is storage-agnostic, unit tests are
                            written and executed on an in-memory storage, which is much faster.
                            Integration tests run for both in-memory and real storage which allows to spot possible
                            timing issues.</p>
                            </li>
                        <li><p><b>Open Source.</b> Permissive Apache License allows using the framework in closed-source
                            projects. You are welcome to contribute to the framework development.</p></li>
