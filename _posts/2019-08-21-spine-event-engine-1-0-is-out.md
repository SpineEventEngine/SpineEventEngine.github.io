We are glad to announce the release of the first production-ready version of Spine Event Engine!

What started as a dream tool concept to help us build event-driven applications, grew and evolved into a full-fledged CQRS/ES framework for cloud and enterprise.

<!--more-->

**In a nutshell:** Spine Event Engine is a framework for building cloud applications and transforming #EventStorming artifacts into a working domain model code.

**What's in Spine for businesses:**
The framework helps build modern event-driven applications, closely reflecting business reality, in days not months. It is free for use, however professional consultancy and support are available if necessary.

**What's in Spine for developers:**
Created with Event Sourcing as a key concept, CQRS as a pattern, and Domain-Driven Design in its heart, Spine extends the [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) code-generation technology offered by Google for the needs of the event-driven apps, takes care of the boilerplate code, data flow, and storage, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than plumbing.

**What's the proof:**
Honing Spine to work as conceived, we have built several cloud applications on top of it. One of them, created for the U. S. client, runs commercially since 2017.

**Where do you start:**
Get a general overview of the framework [key concepts]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/introduction/concepts.html) or if you would rather see it working right away, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/spine-examples/).

**Chime in!**
We answer questions on Spine use in [our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/SpineEventEngine/community).
Should you want to join us in improving the framework, see the code in the [Spine Event Engine organization](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/) on GitHub.

**What's next:**
We are currently working on making Spine support more platforms and environments, and extending the integration with web UI. We will announce the updates [@SpineEngine Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpineEngine).
