<!--
Generates the canonical URL for a page. It helps search engines
understand the preferred version of a page.

If the page exists in the main version of Docs, its URL will be displayed.

The custom canonical URL can be provided via page front-matter, for example:
```
canonical_page_url: docs/tutorials/
```
Note that the link must not start with a slash. It makes sense to use the custom
URL if it should navigate to a completely different page.
