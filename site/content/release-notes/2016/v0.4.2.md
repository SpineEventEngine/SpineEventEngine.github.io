# Spine 0.4.2

## CoreJvm

### Features & Improvements

- Starting from this version we added an ability to import events via special command. 
  This may be useful for:
    - importing data via transforming it to aggregate events (as facts in the past);
    - integrating with external data sources.
- Following the best practices, now we use `StreamObserver.onError()` instead of returning responses 
  while posting integration events. The same approach is used in `CommandBus`.
- New custom Protobuf options were introduced: `internal`, `SPI`, `experimental` and `beta`. 
  They are to be used as the similar Java annotations.

Improvements always come together with some new wisdom and old issues correction. Here is the 
one for release 0.4.2.

- Rescheduling commands from the storage now happens in parallel on `CommandBus` creation. 
  This way we avoid blocking of the client code execution.
