# Spine 1.1.2

## Base Libraries

This release brings several improvements and bug fixes to the library.

#### Notable changes:
- A new `Field` utility is introduced for working with Protobuf field paths. The new functionality 
mirrors and extends the existing `FieldPaths` utility which is now deprecated ([#467]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/467)).
- `Tests` utility is extended with method `halt()` for failing on unexpected method calls ([#464]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/464)).
- `Stringifiers.toString(...)` now correctly processes the `enum` values ([#462]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/462)).
- Test utilities now use the latest release version of Google Truth. Minor backward compatibility 
issues may be expected at the users' end ([#463]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/463)).

## CoreJvm

- Several API improvements for entity repositories - [#1172]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1172).
