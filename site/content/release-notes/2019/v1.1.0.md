# Spine 1.1.0

## CoreJvm

This release brings several API enhancements as well as performance and 
stability improvements.

#### API changes

- New API for importing events from third-party systems ([#1152]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1152)). 
For that, users may represent a third-party system as a Bounded Context. A&nbsp;`ThirdPartyContext` 
publishes events submitted by the user as external events so that Spine-based Contexts may 
subscribe/react on them. Example:

```java
ThirdPartyContext context = ThirdPartyContext.multitenant("GitHub Issues");
ActorContext actor = // ...
EventMessage event = IssueClosed
        .newBuilder()
        // ...
        .vBuild();
context.emittedEvent(event, actor);
```

- Deprecation of `@ByField` filtering in event subscribers. Now, the subscriber parameter itself 
should be annotated with `@Where` ([#1159]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1159)).
- New extension points in the `Delivery` mechanism allow for fine-tuning ([#1153]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1153)).
- `IntegrationBus` seized to exist. Instead, we introduce new internal components which perform 
the same job. Public API for SPI users was NOT changed ([#1156]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1156)).
- Test utilities now use the latest release version of Google Truth. Minor backward compatibility 
issues may be expected at the users' end ([#1146]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1146)).

#### Other changes

This release brings a number of performance improvements, most notably in the System Context 
([#1140]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1140)) and in the handler method scan process 
([#1147]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1147), [#1148]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1148)).
