# Spine 1.3.0

## Base Libraries
This PR brings several API improvements to the library.

#### Notable changes:

- A `KnownMessage` interface is introduced. It marks the messages that are generated with Spine 
Model Compiler and can provide their `typeUrl()` ([#495]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/495)).
- The deprecated `FieldPaths` utility is now removed ([#495]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/495)).
- A lot of third-party dependencies are updated to the newer version ([#496]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/496)).
- The conversion routines in `TypeConverter` will now support the number-based `EnumValue` 
instances ([#501]({{% get-site-data "repositories.base_libraries_repo" %}}/pull/501)).

## CoreJvm
This release includes several API improvements for the library, as well as some new features.

#### Notable changes:

- The new high-level client API is introduced ([#1186]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1186)).
- Rejection classes can now be properly subscribed to ([#1193]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1193))
- Several multi-threading tweaks are applied to improve the delivery process ([#1200]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1200)).
- The `AggregateHistoryCorrupted` event is added. It signals to the user that the aggregate state 
has become invalid and the aggregate cannot handle any more incoming signals ([#1199]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1199)).
- It's now allowed to subscribe to the same rejection type multiple times with the different causes ([#1205]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1205)).
- The subscription topic is now additionally validated on the client to fail fast on invalid topic 
creation ([#1197]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1197)).
- The `spine.core.Version` can now be specified in the ordering filters for queries and subscriptions ([#1198]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1198)).
- The `BlackBoxBoundedContext`-based tests now have a `DiagnosticLog` which logs all received diagnostic 
events with a meaningful message ([#1209]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1209)).
- The `CannotDispatchDuplicateEvent` and `CannotDispatchDuplicateCommand` now provide the type of 
the duplicate signal ([#1209]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1209)).
- A lot of third-party dependencies are updated to the newer version ([#1195]({{% get-site-data "repositories.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1195)).

## Web
A public release of the Spine Web library.

In this release, the client API got a revamp to simplify calls and provide all the features that 
the Java client provides. See [#125]({{% get-site-data "repositories.web_repo" %}}/pull/125), [#127]({{% get-site-data "repositories.web_repo" %}}/pull/127).
