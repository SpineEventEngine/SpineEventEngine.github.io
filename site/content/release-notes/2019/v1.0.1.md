# Spine 1.0.1

## CoreJvm

This is a performance and maintenance release of Spine `core` libraries.

#### Changes:

- The performance of `AggregateRepository.index()` was improved by delegating to an Aggregate 
mirror  — [#1138]({{% get-site-data "spine.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1138).
- The subscription registry synchronization was improved. Now the creation of the repetitive 
subscriptions to the same `Target` behaves as expected — [#1139]({{% get-site-data "spine.core_jvm_repo" %}}/pull/1139).
