## Principles

These are the principles our framework is based on:

- Events, Commands, and identifiers should be **strongly typed**.
- It should be **easy to pass data** between different programming languages and platforms. We want
  a domain language to become truly Ubiquitous.
- Objects must be **immutable** unless there is a good reason not to do so.
- Developers should spend **more time on business logic** rather than plumbing related to storage
  matters or server environment aspects.
- The code should be **easier to test**.
