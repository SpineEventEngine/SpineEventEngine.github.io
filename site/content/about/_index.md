{{% note-block class="lead" %}}
**Spine Event Engine** is a framework for building cloud applications. It helps applying 
Domain-Driven Design faster and smarter, with less&nbsp;code.
{{% /note-block %}}

Our goal is to free developers from writing boilerplate code as much as possible. The framework
helps and encourages applying architectural patterns such as Message-Driven Architecture, Event
Sourcing, CQRS, and&nbsp;Microservices.

The data model is defined in Protobuf and compiled into performant code in multiple languages.
The backend logic is written in Java. Client libraries are available for [Java][java], 
[JavaScript][javascript], and [Dart][dart].
