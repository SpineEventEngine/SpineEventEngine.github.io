# Spine 1.0.1

<p class="lead">This is a performance and maintenance release of Spine `core` libraries.</p>

## Changes:

- The performance of `AggregateRepository.index()` was improved by delegating to an Aggregate mirror.
- The subscription registry synchronization was improved. Now the creation of the repetitive 
subscriptions to the same `Target` behaves as expected.
