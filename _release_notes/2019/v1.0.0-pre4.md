# Spine 1.0.0-pre4

## Base

Since `1.0.0-pre3` there were several improvements to the library. Notable changes are listed below.

- Spine JavaScript plugin for Gradle sets proper `require`s for the Protobuf-generated 
files ([#298]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/298)).
- Duplicated rejections are no longer generated for the libraries in the 
classpath ([#299]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/299)).
- `enrichment` option was removed ([#312]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/312)).
- Proto descriptors are no longer merged into one file by default ([#307]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/307)).
- Marker interfaces are now generated for enrichments as well ([#314]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/314)).

## Core Java

Moving closer to the public release, this pre-release brings a few improvements to 
the library users.

- `SubscriptionService` now allows to subscribe to domain events in addition to entity state updates.
See [#961]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/961).
- `(enrichment)` option is removed in favor of `(enrichment_for)` and `(by)` options.
See [base#308]({{site.base_repo}}/issues/308).

The Gradle version was updated to 5.2.
