# Spine 1.0.0-pre4

Moving closer to the public release, this pre-release brings a few improvements to 
the library users.

- `SubscriptionService` now allows to subscribe to domain events in addition to entity state updates.
- `(enrichment)` option is removed in favor of `(enrichment_for)` and `(by)` options.

The Gradle version was updated to 5.2.
