# Spine 1.1.2

## Core Java

This release of Spine `core` libraries includes:

- Several API improvements for entity repositories - [#1172]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1172).
- The documentation improvements for the `@React` annotation - [#1171]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1171).

## Base

This release brings several improvements and bug fixes to the library.

#### Notable changes:
- A new `Field` utility is introduced for working with Protobuf field paths. The new functionality 
mirrors and extends the existing `FieldPaths` utility which is now deprecated ([#467]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/467)).
- `Tests` utility is extended with method `halt()` for failing on unexpected method calls ([#464]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/464)).
- `Stringifiers.toString(...)` now correctly processes the `enum` values ([#462]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/462)).
- Test utilities now use the latest release version of Google Truth. Minor backward compatibility 
issues may be expected at the users' end ([#463]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/463)).

## Bootstrap

A public release of Spine Bootstrap plugin.

The plugin sets up all necessary dependencies and configurations to start building 
Spine-based projects.

## Web

A public release of the Spine Web library which includes the Spine web API and its implementation 
based on the Firebase Realtime Database.

## Time

A public release of Spine Time library.

The library assists in working with Protobuf-based Date/Time types.
