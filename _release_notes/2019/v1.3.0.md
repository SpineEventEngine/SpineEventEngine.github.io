# Spine 1.3.0

<p class="lead">This release includes several API improvements for the library, as well as 
some new features.</p>

## Notable changes:

- The new high-level client API is introduced.
- Rejection classes can now be properly subscribed to
- Several multi-threading tweaks are applied to improve the delivery process.
- The `AggregateHistoryCorrupted` event is added. It signals to the user that the aggregate state 
has become invalid and the aggregate cannot handle any more incoming signals.
- It's now allowed to subscribe to the same rejection type multiple times with the different causes.
- The subscription topic is now additionally validated on the client to fail fast on invalid topic 
creation.
- The `spine.core.Version` can now be specified in the ordering filters for queries and subscriptions.
- The `BlackBoxBoundedContext`-based tests now have a `DiagnosticLog` which logs all received diagnostic 
events with a meaningful message.
- The `CannotDispatchDuplicateEvent` and `CannotDispatchDuplicateCommand` now provide the type of 
the duplicate signal.
- A lot of third-party dependencies are updated to the newer version.
