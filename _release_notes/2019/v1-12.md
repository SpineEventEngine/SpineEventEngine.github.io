# Spine 1.12

<p class="lead">Please meet a major update of Spine --- version 2.0! It introduces fundamental 
changes to the public [API]({{ site.baseurl }}/apidoc/2.0/index.html) of the library allowing 
lots of new features and space for further growth.</p>

We have improved the library implementation to make it compatible with .NET Standard 2.0. 
As a result, DotNetBrowser 2.0 supports .NET Core 2.2 as well as 3.0 on Windows.

## Second level title
Starting with this version DotNetBrowser no longer supports .NET Framework 4.0.
