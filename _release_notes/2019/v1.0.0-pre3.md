# Spine 1.0.0-pre3

## Core Java

This pre-release brings many internal changes, simplifications, and development 
infrastructure refactoring.

#### Framework API Changes

- the `Sharding` and all the connected concepts are deleted ([#929]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/929));
- the Model Verifier plugin now runs the command handler signature checks and fails/logs warnings 
on signature mismatches ([#930]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/930));
- `BoundedContextBuilder` now facades the context components building (such as `IntegrationBus`) 
([#929]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/929));
- `PmSubject` class is added in order to allow testing process managers using Truth 
([#939]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/939));
- `Entity` hierarchy is flattened and cleaned up ([#940]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/940));
- the version of Gradle is updated to `5.1.1` which affects the users of Spine Gradle plugins
([#932]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/932)).

#### Various Fixes

- `@VisibleForTesting` annotation on `ProcessManager.getBuilder()` method is properly 
documented ([#913]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/913));
- internal API clean up ([#933]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/933));
- make the `RecordBasedRepository` able to find archived or/and deleted entities 
([#939]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/939)).

## Base

This pre-release brings several fixes and API improvements to the `base` library.

#### Fixes

- `required` option now works for `oneof` fields ([#240]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/240));
- `repeated` fields now may be included in `FieldMasks` ([#250]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/250));
- removed `ValidatingBuilder`s for standard types ([#252]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/252));
- removed `modelCompiler. generateBuildersFromClasspath` ([#252]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/252));
- `ValidatingBuilder`s generation attempts are dropped and warnings are not logged any 
more ([#268]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/268)).
- generated field annotation lookup bug is fixed ([#269]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/269));
- `ValidatingBuilder`s for nested types are now generated ([#272]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/272));
- constraint validation error messages are now more readable ([#279]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/279));


#### API improvements

- `(is)` and `(every_is)` options now allow implementing existing Java interfaces ([#248]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/248));
- introduced `(set_once)` field option, which does not allow to change the value of a field after 
it was once set ([#257]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/257), [#275]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/275));
- numeric and boolean Protobuf types do not support `(required)`; a message is logged on the 
option misuse; ([#266]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/266));
- generated identifier types now support factory methods for convenience ([#267]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/267));
- generated code is now marked with Java annotation types which can be specified ([#280]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/280));
- selected generated methods and classes now can be marked as `@Internal` ([#284]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/284), [#287]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/287)).
