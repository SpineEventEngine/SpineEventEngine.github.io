# Spine 1.0.0-pre3

<p class="lead">This pre-release brings many internal changes, simplifications, and development 
infrastructure refactoring.</p>

## Framework API Changes

- the `Sharding` and all the connected concepts are deleted;
- the Model Verifier plugin now runs the command handler signature checks and fails/logs warnings 
on signature mismatches;
- `BoundedContextBuilder` now facades the context components building (such as `IntegrationBus`);
- `PmSubject` class is added in order to allow testing process managers using Truth;
- `Entity` hierarchy is flattened and cleaned up;
- the version of Gradle is updated to `5.1.1` which affects the users of Spine Gradle plugins.

## Various Fixes

- `@VisibleForTesting` annotation on `ProcessManager.getBuilder()` method is properly documented;
- internal API clean up;
- make the `RecordBasedRepository` able to find archived or/and deleted entities.
