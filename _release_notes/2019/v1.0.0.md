# Spine 1.0.0

## Base

This is the first public release of `base` modules.

#### Notable API changes:

- SLF4J logging is replaced by Flogger ([#451]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/451)).
- Protobuf messages generated with Spine plugins may now be built with validation by 
calling `.vBuild()` ([#409]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/409)). The generation of separate `...VBuilder` 
classes was removed.
- External libraries may now register custom validation options ([#408]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/408)).

## Core Java

This is the first public release of Spine core modules.

#### Most notable changes:

- `ServerEnvironment` is now responsible for the configuration of the server-wide routines, such 
as `StorageFactory`, `TransportFactory` and `Delivery`.
- System Bounded Context is now configurable — [#1115]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1115). It was 
simplified and made less intrusive — [#1084]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1084).
- Entities now receive messages via `Inbox`, which supports message sharding and de-duplication 
in a multi-node environment — [#1096]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1096).
- Trace API was introduced — [#1090]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1090).
- Errors during the message dispatching no longer throw exceptions. A series of system events 
was introduced instead — [#1104]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1104).
- `ConstraintViolated` system event was introduced — [#1081]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1081).
- `BoundedContext` configuration was simplified. Also, `BoundedContextBuilder` is now the only API 
to set up the context; all the duplicating API calls were removed from the `BoundedContext` 
itself — [#1108]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1108).
- It is now possible to `@Command` upon external events — [#1116]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1116). 
- `@Command` methods which accept events, may now ignore them — [#1114]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1114).
- `BlackBoxBoundedContext` API was extended with an ability to assert `Query` and `Subscription` 
behavior by using the corresponding test subjects — [#1124]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1124), 
[#1126]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1126).
- `BlackBoxBoundedContext` API is now the only way to test the applications built with Spine. 
The previous unit-testing framework was removed — [#1110]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1110).
- Entity `@Column` API marked as `@Experimental`, as we can still see a room for API improvement 
and further changes — [#1134]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1134).
- `IntegrationBus` behavior on handling new `BoundedContext`s was fixed — [#1120]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1120).
- Previously deprecated API was removed — [#1122]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1122).

Also, we created a [chat on Gitter](https://gitter.im/{{site.gitter_username}}) for answering 
the questions on the framework use. Please feel free to join and say hi!
