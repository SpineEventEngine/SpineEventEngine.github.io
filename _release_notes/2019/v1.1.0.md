# Spine 1.1.0

<p class="lead">This release brings several API enhancements as well as performance and 
stability improvements.</p>

## API changes

- New API for importing events from third-party systems. For that, users may represent 
a third-party system as a Bounded Context. A `ThirdPartyContext` publishes events submitted 
by the user as external events so that Spine-based Contexts may subscribe/react on them. 
Example:

```java
ThirdPartyContext context = ThirdPartyContext.multitenant("GitHub Issues");
ActorContext actor = // ...
EventMessage event = IssueClosed
        .newBuilder()
        // ...
        .vBuild();
context.emittedEvent(event, actor);
```

- Deprecation of `@ByField` filtering in event subscribers. Now, the subscriber parameter itself 
should be annotated with `@Where`.
- New extension points in the `Delivery` mechanism allow for fine-tuning.
- `IntegrationBus` seized to exist. Instead, we introduce new internal components which perform 
the same job. Public API for SPI users was NOT changed.
- Test utilities now use the latest release version of Google Truth. Minor backward compatibility 
issues may be expected at the users' end.

## Other changes

This release brings a number of performance improvements, most notably in the System Context 
and in the handler method scan process.
