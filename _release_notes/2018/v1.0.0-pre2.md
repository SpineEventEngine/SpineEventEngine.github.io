# Spine 1.0.0-pre2

<p class="lead">This version brings test API updates, bug fixes and performance optimizations.</p>

## Improvements in the test framework

- `TestClient` utility.
- Several features in `BlackBoxBoundedContext`.
- New factory methods in `GivenUserId`.

## Optimizations

- Read less data upon each Aggregate load.
- Add forceful `GrpcContainer. shutdownNowAndWait ()` to reduce waiting time.

## Resolved issues

- Make `ProcessManager` versioned properly.
- Ignore `Empty` and `Nothing` returning values from `@Command`-er handlers.
- Do not detect entity columns if no `@Column` annotation was explicitly set.
- When creating actor requests, do not require both zone offset and zone ID from clients; 
calculate zone offset automatically.
