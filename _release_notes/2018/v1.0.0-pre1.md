# Spine 1.0.0-pre1

<p class="lead">This is a preview release of the Spine 1.0 version.</p>

## New Maven Repository

In this version one more artifact repository is introduced:

- Releases: [https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/releases](https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/releases)
- Snapshots: [https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/snapshots](https://spine.mycloudrepo.io/public/repositories/snapshots)

The [previously used repository](https://maven.teamdev.com/repository/spine/) is also maintained.

## Features and Improvements

Since 0.10.0 several significant features were introduced, making the framework near the 
feature completeness:

- Provide automatic idempotency for the business entities.
- Allow to subscribe to the entity state updates.
- Allow to produce a command in response to an event or a command â€” the `@Commanding` methods.
- Introduce System bounded context, which tracks the history of each `Command`, `Event` 
and `Entity`, allowing to trace paths and consequences of incoming end-user imperatives.
- Make `Rejections` a special kind of `Event`s to simplify thinking for framework users.

In addition the framework now uses [Error Prone](https://errorprone.info/) with a conjunction 
with the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/), which allows to catch the potential 
issues on a compilation stage.

Lots of other less significant improvements were introduced, addressing the issues reported 
from the real-world use-cases.

## Dependency Updates

The framework dependencies were updated as follows.

- gRPC 1.15.0
- Protobuf 3.6.1
- Protobuf Gradle plugin 0.8.5
- Guava 26.0-jre
- JUnit 5.3.1
- Google Truth 0.42
