# Spine 0.6.0

## Features & Improvements

Version 0.6.0 introduces a main read-side concept — Stand.

It provides query and subscription API on per-`BoundedContext` basis, acting as a facade for data 
retrieval. Being downstream with the Repositories, Stand also stores the latest Aggregate states, 
making the state fetch much more efficient.

Application interface has been extended with a couple of read-side oriented gRPC services:

- `QueryService` — enabling synchronous state retrieval;
- `SubscriptionService` — allowing to subscribe for entity state changes.

### Structural Changes:

- `ClientService` has been renamed `toCommandService`; its subscription-related methods were moved to 
the newly introduced `SubscriptionService`.

- Model definitions and services related to `Users` domain were moved to a separate users module.

- Examples have been extracted as a separate repository.

## Dependency Updates

- gRPC 1.0.0.
- Protobuf Gradle Plugin 0.8.0
