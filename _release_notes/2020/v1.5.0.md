# Spine 1.5.0

This major update of the library brings a number of new features and performance improvements.

- Projections now support an automated run-time catch-up.
- The client API was made less error-prone by enforcing the strong typing for the columns and 
properties of Entities and Events. The list of the model fields is generated as Java code by the 
Spine compiler at build-time.
- A data migration API is now available for `ProcessManagers` and `Projections`. It automates the 
process of updating the existing data upon the changes in the domain model.
- The logging records made from within the Entity handlers now print the full signature of the 
called method.
- It is now possible to specify an actor when composing a test scenario with `BlackBoxBoundedContext` 
API.
- `CommandBus` is no longer responsible for validating the first field of the transmitted 
`Command`s; instead, this is a job of the `Repository` for the target `Entity`.

The API of `InboxMessage` has been changed so that any of the existing `InboxMessages` become 
incompatible. Please make sure to deliver the messages from all of your production `Inbox`es prior 
to updating to the new version.

Also, a number of minor improvements and issues were addressed. Please see the list of closed pull 
requests for more details.
