# Spine 0.10.0

This release brings even more features to the framework, making it very close to `1.0` release.

IMPORTANT. The framework package names were renamed from `org.spine3.*` to `io.spine.*`.

Here is a quick summary of changes. For more details please refer to the [list of pull requests](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/core-java/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20merged%3A2017-05-03T16%3A00%3A00%2B03%3A00..2017-10-17) and Javadocs.

#### Reacting upon `Events` and `Rejection`s

It is now possible to emit events in reaction to other events. This is particularly useful 
for `AggregatePart`s:

```java
/**
 * A part of {@code Task}  aggregate. Defines the essence of a task.
 */
public class TaskDefinition 
    extends AggregatePart<TaskId, Task, TaskVBuilder, TaskRoot> {

    @Assign
    public TaskCompleted handle(CompleteTask cmd) {
        // Handle the command and emit a `TaskCompleted` event.
        // ...
        return taskCompletedEvent;
    }

    @Apply
    void on(TaskCompleted event) {
        // Update state accordingly.
        // ...
    }
} 

/**
 * Another part of {@code Task}  aggregate. Responsible for all comments 
 * of a single task.
 */
public class TaskComments 
    extends AggregatePart<TaskId, TaskComments, TaskCommentsVBuilder, TaskRoot> {

    @React
    public TaskCommentingDisabled handle(TaskCompleted event) {
        // Disable commenting of the completed task.
        //...
        return commentingDisabledEvent;
    }

    @Apply
    void on(TaskCommentingDisabled event) {
        // Update own state as well.
        // ...
    }
}
```

In the example above `TaskComments` reacts to the event, emitted by another part and updates 
own state. Before such a feature became available, an intermediate `ProcessManager` should have 
been used for this purpose.

It is also possible to `@React` upon a rejection in the same manner.

This feature is available for `Aggregate`, `AggregatePart` and `ProcessManager` entities.

#### Entity API Updates

All the `Entity` implementations, which are able to handle events, are now descendants of a newly 
introduced `EventPlayingEntity`. Its API allows to play events in a unified fashion.

Entity state modification is now available via `ValidatingBuilder`.

The direct state update, which was previously available to `Projection`s, `Aggregate`s and 
`ProcessManagers` via numerous methods (such as `updateState` and `incrementState`), is NOT 
available anymore. The designed way to modify the entity is via `getBuilder().set...` calls.

In addition, an automatic version management is introduced. For each applied event the version 
is automatically incremented. Direct version modification is not exposed as public API anymore.

For more details please see [#466]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/466).

#### Entity Column Queries

It is now possible to use `EntityColumns` in the queries:
```java
public class CustomerProjection 
    extends Projection<CustomerId, Customer, CustomerVBuilder> {

    // ...

    // Defines an entity column.
    public PersonName getContactName() {
        return getState().getContactPerson().getName();
    }
}
```

Then in your client code:
```java
// Retrieve customers by a contact name.

// Obtain the parameters for the query from somewhere like user interface.
final PersonName contactName = getContactName();

// Create the `Query` instance.
final Query customerQuery = myRequestFactory.query()
                                            .select(Customer.class)
                                            .withMask("id", "address", "domain")
                                            .where(eq("contactName", contactName))
                                            .build();

// Get the client stub of the `QueryService`.
final QueryService queryService = getServerApi();

// Execute the query, setting the callback for results.
queryService.read(query, callback);
```

In the example above the results will contain customers, whose `contactPerson.name` value 
matches the one set in the query.

#### `IntegrationBus`

To integrate several `BoundedContexts`, an `IntegrationBus` is defined. It allows to subscribe 
to so called "external" events in one `BoundedContext` to receive events of a required type 
from another `BoundedContext`.

E.g. the first bounded context `Projects` defines an external event handler method in 
the projection as follows:

```java
public class ProjectListView extends Projection<...> {

    @Subscribe(external = true)
    public void on(UserDeleted event) {
        // Remove the projects that belong to this user.
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```

Let's say the second bounded context is `Users`. In case these bounded contexts share the same 
transport, any `UserDeleted` event emitted inside of `Users` will also get delivered to 
`ProjectListView` of `Projects` bounded context. It will be done via `IntegrationBus`.

For more details see [#580]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/580).

#### One-liner updates

- Base data types and utilities have been extracted into [`base` repository](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/base/).
- `core` module was introduced in the `core-java` repository; it defines classes and interfaces, 
that are essential for building application in the Event Sourcing paradigm.
- Custom Protobuf options defined by the framework now take numbers in the range `73812-75000`.
- `Failure` is renamed to `Rejection` to comply with Reactive Manifesto [definition of “Failure”](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Failure) better.
- `EndpointDelivery` strategy is now available; it allows to define how messages are delivered 
to particular `Entity` instances.
- Entity visibility options are added; `VisibilityGuard` is a registry of repositories that 
controls an access.

#### Version updates

- Gradle 4.1.
- Protobuf 3.3.0.
- gRPC 1.4.0.
