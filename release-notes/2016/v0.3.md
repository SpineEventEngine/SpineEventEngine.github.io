# Spine 0.3

## Core Java

- Added SPI annotation to enable framework extension and replaceable components 
(implement a new storage, etc.).
- Added a requirement to mark entity protobuf state definitions with the `state_of` annotation.
- Added business Failures to distinguish from technical errors.
- Added Target ID as first required field in commands for entities.
- Removed file system storage implementation since JDBC storage can be used instead.
- Changed event and command IDs to be based on string UUID â€” previously they were composed of 
several fields, now they are part of Context.
- Added ClientService definition for establishing client connection, posting commands and receiving 
stream of events.
- Changed project module structure to: `client`, `server` and `values`.
- Added the default implementation of the `getDefaultState()` method to Entity.

response to a command received by the ProcessManager.
- Added protobuf custom options for message validation ( for commands on posting).
- Added storage tests that can be used in different storage implementations.
- Added the ability to store the status of command processing to Command Store.
- Added the ability for Process Manager Repository to retrieve Process Manager ID from handled 
events and commands.
- Added integration with Java Code Coverage (JaCoCo).
