# Spine 1.7.5

## Core Java

This is a patch release of Spine 1.x. It follows up on the production use of Spine libraries 
and brings a few requested improvements.

* The integration with gRPC server has been improved for better results in dealing with heavy-duty 
subscriptions.
* `BlackBoxContext` API has been extended with a few endpoints to test for the positive outcomes.

Additionally, several improvements of `config` scripts were brought to this version.
