# Spine 1.7.0

## Base

This release brings internal API improvements, better support for the tooling and Dart as well as 
improvements to the `Environment` and tests APIs.

### Breaking Changes

1. Removed deprecated APIs in the `UtilityClassTest` class.

    Please use `subject()` over removed `getUtilityClass()`.
    
2. Removed deprecated methods in the `Validate` utility.

    Please consider migrating to mirrored methods in `Preconditions2` and check out the 
    related PR [#596]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/596).
    
3. Removed deprecated methods in the `Environment` utility and introduced a new 
`CustomEnvironmentType` abstraction for custom environments.

    Consider changing your custom environments parent class from `EnvironmentType` to 
    `CustomEnvironmentType`. And when registering new environments please use 
    `Environment.register(Class<? extends CustomEnvironmentType>)` or the previously accessible 
    method with an environment instance argument.
    
    Please use `Environment.instance().is(Tests.class)` over the previously deprecated and now 
    removed `Environment.isTests()`.
    
    Please use `Environment.instance().is(Production.class)` over the previously deprecated and 
    now removed `Environment.isProduction()`.
    
    To set a custom environment please use the `Environment.setTo(Class<? extends EnvironmentType>)` 
    over the previously available method with an environment instance argument. Also, use the same 
    method over the previously deprecated and now removed `Environment.setToTests()` and 
    `Environment.setToProduction()`.
    
    Consult PR [#594]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/594) for extra details on the improvements and 
    removals of the deprecated APIs.

4. `MethodFactory` and `NestedClassFactory` interfaces are extracted into a separate 
`spine-tools-api` artifact.

    In case you were implementing a custom `MethodFactory` or `NestedClassFactory`, please 
    consider adding the `spine-tools-api` dependency to the respective module.
    
    You can use the following snippet to add the dependency to your Gradle project:
    
    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
       implementation("io.spine.tools:spine-tools-api:1.7.0")
    }
    ```

### API changes

On top of the breaking changes here are some minor API changes introduced in the release.

1. `Resource.file(String)` is deprecated in favor of `Resource.file(String, ClassLoader)`.

    It is always recommended to provide a particular `ClassLoader` instance to achieve predictable 
    and reproducible access to resources while using the `Resource` utility. Please consult 
    PR [#566]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/566) for more details on the matter.

2. The new `SingletonClassTest` test abstraction to simplify testing singletons. 
(see PR [#583]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/583) for details).

3. Improved test assertions support with the new `Assertions` and `TempDir` utilities available 
in the `testlib` project.

    The `Assertions` utility provides convenient assertions to verify that one of the exceptions 
    was thrown by introducing the following methods:

    ```java
    /**
     * Asserts that running the passed executable causes {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
     */
    @CanIgnoreReturnValue
    public static IllegalArgumentException assertIllegalArgument(Executable e)

    /**
     * Asserts that running the passed executable causes {@link IllegalStateException}.
     */
    @CanIgnoreReturnValue
    public static IllegalStateException assertIllegalState(Executable e)

    /**
     * Asserts that running the passed executable causes {@link UnknownTypeException}.
     */
    @CanIgnoreReturnValue
    public static UnknownTypeException assertUnknownType(Executable e)

    /**
     * Asserts that running the passed executable cases {@link NullPointerException}.
     */
    @CanIgnoreReturnValue
    public static NullPointerException assertNpe(Executable e)
    ```

    The `TempDir` provides a replacement for the deprecated `com.google.common.io.Files#createTempDir()`.

    Please consult PR [#585]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/585) for additional details.

4. The `TypeUrl` prefix is the Protobuf file declaration may now be empty.

    One may now specify an empty `(type_url_prefix)` option in the Protobuf if she does not 
    intend to use the type URLs.

    The following declaration is now fully legit:
    
    ```protobuf
	syntax = "proto3";

	package spine.test.type;

	import "spine/options.proto";

	option (type_url_prefix) = "";
	option java_package = "io.spine.test.type";
	option java_outer_classname = "NoPrefixProto";
	option java_multiple_files = true;

	message TypeWithoutPrefix {
	  string value = 1;
	}
    ```

    PR [#588]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/588) provides more information on the matter.

5. The `Diags` utility now provides additional `Collector`s for commonly used diagnostics.

    The new `Diags.toEnumeration()` joins the item's string representation with a comma followed 
    by a space character.
    
    ```java
    ImmutableList<String> list = ImmutableList.of("foo", "bar", "baz");
    String output = list.stream().collect(Diags.toEnumeration());
    System.out.println(output); // prints "foo, bar, baz"
    ```

    The `Diags.toEnumerationBackticked` wraps each item's string representation into backticks and 
    then joins to the result string with a comma followed by a space character.

    ```java
    ImmutableList<String> list = ImmutableList.of("foo", "bar", "baz");
    String output = list.stream().collect(Diags.toEnumerationBackticked());
    System.out.println(output); // prints "`foo`, `bar`, `baz`"
    ```

### Fixes

1. Gradle Proto Dart plugin now resolves relative imports (see [#572]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/572) 
and [#573]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/573)).

2. Enum values now also support `(distinct)` validation options (see 
[#437]({{site.base_repo}}/issues/437) and [#587]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/587)).

### Infrastructure

1. Spine Protoc plugin is now started by the Gradle Protobuf plugin without custom launch scripts 
(see [#586]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/586) for details).

2. Proto Dart plugin resolves the `pub` cache better with the new `PubCache` utility 
(see [#589]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/589)).

3. The libraries now do not use `implementation` for compile-only annotations like 
`errorprone` annotations but use the newly 
[introduced](https://docs.gradle.org/6.7.1/release-notes.html#new-dependency-management-features) 
`compileOnlyApi` configuration for such dependencies (see [#597]({{site.base_repo}}/pull/597)).

## Core Java

This release brings numerous API improvements, as well as fixes and infrastructure updates 
to the framework.

### Breaking Changes

1. The `BlackBoxContext`-based tests now fail if a runtime exception was thrown within the 
signal handlers.

    In order to address [#1314]({{site.core_java_repo}}/issues/1314), we've decided to enforce 
    the fail-fast approach within the BBC tests done in [#1322]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1322). 
    From now on, if a test case had any runtime exceptions thrown from signal handlers the test is 
    failed by the BBC. While it may be a breaking change for some, we believe it worth fixing such 
    issues right away than hiding them under the carpet.

    If one requires to fall back to the previous behavior, the BBC instance can be configured using 
    the newly introduced `tolerateFailures` method. 

2. The `grand_origin` field is no longer set to a default instance for the signal `Origin` if no 
grand origin is present (see [#1341]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1341) for details).

3. The `ServerEnvironment` API is improved and changed as a result of the 
[#1315]({{site.core_java_repo}}/issues/1315) and related discussions in a series of PRs 
([#1327]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1327), [#1331]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1331), 
[#1336]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1336)).

    The previously deprecated `configure...()` API is removed in favor of the new fluent 
    `when().use()` API.

    So now, instead of smth like this:

    ```java
    ServerEnvironment.use(productionStorageFactory, Production.class)
                     .use(testingStorageFactory, Tests.class)
                     .use(memoizingTracerFactory, Production.class)
    ```
    
    One should use the following snippet:

    ```java
    ServerEnvironment.when(Production.class)
                     .use(productionStorageFactory)
                     .use(memoizingTracerFactory);
    ServerEnvironment.when(Tests.class)
                     .use(testingStorageFactory);
    ```

### API Changes

1. `Change` type validation requirements are relaxed for primitive type changes.

    The `new_value` field is no longer a required one for `StringChange` and `BytesChange` types. 
    See [#1307]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1307) for details.

2. Introduced simplified `unicast()` methods in the `EventRouting`.

    The new `unicast()` API allows simplifying and prettifying the even routing for the cases 
    where a singular ID is used.

    Now, instead of smth like this:

    ```java
     @OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper
     @Override
     protected void setupEventRouting(EventRouting<AirportId> routing) {
         super.setupEventRouting(routing);
         routing.route(FlightScheduled.class, (e, ctx)-> EventRoute.withId(e.getAirport()));
     }
    ```
   
    One can use the following API:
   
    ```java
     @OverridingMethodsMustInvokeSuper
     @Override
     protected void setupEventRouting(EventRouting<AirportId> routing) {
         super.setupEventRouting(routing);
         routing.unicast(FlightScheduled.class, FlightScheduled::getAirport)
     }
    ```
   
    To find out more details on the new API please check [#1317]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1317).

3. Added `localDate` and `localDateTime` helpers to the `WithTime` interface.

    This feature allows accessing `localDate` and `localDateTime` methods from within all the 
    signals. From now on, if one requires a Java `LocalDate` or `LocalDateTime` instances over 
    the Protobuf `Timestamp` or Java `Instant` that were previously available for signals, they 
    may use the new API to simplify such a conversion and access to the signals `timestamp` field.

    See [#1319]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1319) for additional details.

### Fixes

1. Improved multitenant delivery support by ensuring the tenant is properly propagated within the 
delivery (see [#1308]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1308)).

2. Fixed a typo in the `io.spine.client.Client` `shutdownTimeout` method 
(see [#1339]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1339)).

3. Fixed dispatching of rejections caused by a particular command 
(see [#1318]({{site.core_java_repo}}/issues/1318) and [#1343]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1343)).

### Infrastructure

1. The libraries now do not use `implementation` for compile-only annotations like `errorprone` 
annotations but use the newly [introduced](https://docs.gradle.org/6.7.1/release-notes.html#new-dependency-management-features) 
`compileOnlyApi` configuration for such dependencies (see [#1340]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1340)).

[Compare]({{site.core_java_repo}}/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0) v1.6.0 and v1.7.0.


## Bootstrap

This release brings the support of Spine components in version `1.7.0`.

### Dart support

This release brings experimental support for configuring 
[`spine-dart`]({{site.dart_repo}}) and Protobuf code generation for Dart projects.

For the Dart project setup instructions please see [#74]({{site.bootstrap_repo}}/pull/74).

[Compare]({{site.bootstrap_repo}}/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0) v1.6.0 and v1.7.0.


## Web

A public release of web-related Spine libraries.

### Breaking Changes

1. The default `grand_origin` value must not be set for the signal `Origin` for the filtering 
anymore.

    With the [#160]({{site.web_repo}}/pull/160) and upgrade to the newest version of the 
    [`spine-server`]({{site.core_java_repo}}/pull/1341), the default (empty) `grand_origin` 
    instance must not be set anymore. This change is already done for the JS client, but if one 
    is using a custom solution, she must not set the default `grand_origin`.

2. The `firebase-web` artifact no longer provides the `appengine-sdk` dependency 
(see [#153]({{site.web_repo}}/issues/153) and [#155]({{site.web_repo}}/pull/155)).

### API Changes

1. New `web` test utilities.

    The `testutil-web` artifact now provides new test utilities that simplify the creation of 
    pre-configured servlet requests and responses.

    If one needs an immutable HTTP request or response, she may use the `KnownRequest` and 
    `KnownResponse` entries respectively. They allow setting a constant request or response data 
    and headers that are not gonna be changed while the entry is being used.
     
    If it is required to verify that a response is modified by the underlying code, one may use 
    the `MemoizingResponse` that records actions applied to it and allows getting back the 
    modifications.

    If none of these matches the requirements, the `MockedRequest` and `MockedResponse` interfaces 
    provide default no-op overrides for the respective `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` 
    interfaces and could be implemented to match specific needs.

    See [#159]({{site.web_repo}}/pull/159) for additional details.

### Fixes

1. Fixed keep-up and cancellation of Firebase subscriptions from the `spine-web` client 
(see [#154]({{site.web_repo}}/pull/154)).

### Infrastructure

1. The libraries now do not use `implementation` for compile-only annotations like `errorprone` 
annotations but use the newly [introduced](https://docs.gradle.org/6.7.1/release-notes.html#new-dependency-management-features) 
`compileOnlyApi` configuration for such dependencies (see [#159]({{site.web_repo}}/pull/159)).

#### Dependency upgrades

- base64-js: `1.3.0` -> `1.5.1`
- google-protobuf: `3.8.0` -> `3.13.0`
- isomorphic-fetch: `2.2.1` -> `3.0.0`
- uuid: `3.4.0` -> `8.3.2`

## Google Cloud Java 

A public release of GCP-related Spine libraries.

### Infrastructure

The libraries now do not use `implementation` for compile-only annotations like `errorprone` 
annotations but use the newly [introduced](https://docs.gradle.org/6.7.1/release-notes.html#new-dependency-management-features) 
`compileOnlyApi` configuration for such dependencies (see [#158]({{site.gcloud_java_repo}}/pull/158)).
