<h2 class="top">Rejection</h2> 

Rejection is a state of business logic which can be handled by the end user. 
Consider the following examples of rejections: 
* “credit card validation declined”, 
* “order cannot be empty”, 
* “insufficient funds”.

In Spine, rejections are defined as Protocol buffer messages.
