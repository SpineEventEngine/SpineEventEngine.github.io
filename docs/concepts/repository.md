<h2 class="top">Repository</h2> 

Repository  is a mechanism for encapsulating storage, retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects. 
It isolates domain objects from the details of the database access code. 

The applications you develop using Spine usually have the following types of repositories:
* Aggregate Repository,
* Process Manager Repository,
* Projection Repository.
