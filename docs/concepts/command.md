<h2 class="top">Command</h2> 

Commands are messages that instruct an entity within Spine framework to perform a certain action. Compared with events, command is not a statement of fact. They are a request, and, thus, can be refused. A typical way to convey refusal is to throw an error or rejection. 

In Spine, commands are defined as a Protocol buffer messages.
