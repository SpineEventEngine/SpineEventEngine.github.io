<h2 class="top">Event Reactor</h2> 
Event Reactor is an object which usually produces one or more events in response to an incoming event. 
Unlike <a href="https://spine.io/docs/concepts/event-subsriber.html">Event Subscriber</a>, which always consumes events, a reacting object generates events in response to changes in the domain.
