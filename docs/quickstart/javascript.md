<p>This guide gets you started with Spine in Android Java with a simple
working example.</p>
<hr>


## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

*   `JDK` : version 7 or higher
*   Android SDK
*   An android device set up for [USB
    debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling){:target="_blank"}
    or an [Android Virtual
    Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html){:target="_blank"}

## Run a server application

TBD

#### Connecting via USB

To run the application on a physical device via USB debugging, you must
configure USB port forwarding to allow the device to communicate with the server
running on your computer. This is done via the `adb` command line tool as
follows:

```
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:50051
```

This sets up port forwarding from port `8080` on the device to port `50051` on
the connected computer, which is the port that the Hello World server is
listening on.

Now you can run the Android Hello World app on your device, using `localhost`
and `8080` as the `Host` and `Port`.

#### Connecting via Virtual Device

To run the Hello World app on an Android Virtual Device, you don't need to
enable port forwarding. Instead, the emulator can use the IP address
`10.0.2.2` to refer to the host machine. Inside the Android Hello World app,
enter `10.0.2.2` and `50051` as the `Host` and `Port`.
