<h2 class="top">Getting Started with Spine</h2>

We recommend you get started with Spine by creating an application in [Java](java.html).
<p class="note">Before creating your first application with Spine, familiarize with its [basic concepts and architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/concepts/).</p>
For more detailed tutorials and examples, see the [Tutorials]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tutorials) section for other supported languages:
 - [JavaScript](javascript.html)
 - [C++](cpp.html)
