# Welcome to the Spine developer documentation!

<p class="lead">Spine Event Engine is based on Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, Event-Driven Architecture,
and Event Sourcing. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with the concepts
introduced by DDD and mentioned patterns.</p> 

If you are new to our framework, we recommend that you read the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/introduction/">Introduction</a> section to find
out what it's like to build applications using Spine. This section also gives a brief overview of
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/introduction/concepts.html">key architectural concepts</a> and
how framework users deal with them.
 
The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/guides">Guides</a> section provides detailed instructions
on the framework use.

If you're building a client application for a Spine-based backend, please visit the 
[Client Libraries](/docs/client-libs) section.
 
If you want to see Spine in action first, visit the 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quickstart/">Quick Start</a> section.
