# Starting a new project

<p class="lead">Starting a new project and identifying a particular development flow may 
be challenging at times. Making the flow efficient and straight-forward is even harder.
This guide will walk you through the way we tend to start and develop new projects.</p>

While the development process is described in the [introduction](/docs/introduction) section,
in the guide we want to cover the exact steps that we follow while working on a project.
