# Getting started with Spine in Java

## What we'll do
This guide will walk you through a minimal client-server application in Java
which handles one command to greet the current computer user.

The example shows a Bounded Context called “Hello”. 
The context has one `ProcessManager`, which handles the `Print` command
sent from the client application to the server application, which hosts the context.

## What you'll need
1.  JDK version 8 or higher.
2.  Git.
3.  The source code of the [Hello World](https://github.com/spine-examples/hello) example.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:spine-examples/hello.git
    ```

## Run the code
To check that you've got everything installed, please run the following command:
```bash
./gradlew :sayHello
```
If you're under Windows, it would be:
```
gradlew.bat :sayHello
```
This would build and execute the example. 
The process should finish with the output which looks like this:

```
> Task :sayHello
Jun 04, 2020 5:04:55 PM io.spine.server.Server lambda$start$1
INFO: In-process server started with the name `318ea6c4-283e-4c43-b367-93310b703d31`.
[sanders] Hello World!
The client received the event: io.spine.helloworld.hello.event.Printed{"username":"sanders","text":"Hello World!"}
Jun 04, 2020 5:04:57 PM io.spine.server.Server shutdown
INFO: Shutting down the server...
Jun 04, 2020 5:04:57 PM io.spine.server.Server shutdown
INFO: Server shut down.
```  
Now let's dive into the code.
 
## Project Structure
This example is a single-module Gradle project. This is done so for the sake of simplicity.
Real world applications would be multi-module.

### The root directory
The root of the project contains the following files:
  * `LICENSE` — the text of the Apache v2 license under which the framework and
     this example are licensed.
  * `README.md` — a brief intro for the example.
  * `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` — scripts for running Gradle Wrapper.
  * `build.gradle` — the project configuration. We'll review this file later in details.

<p class="note">The root directory also contains “invisible” files, names of which start with
the dot (e.g. `.gitattributes` and `.travis.yml`).
These files configure Git and CI systems we use. They are not directly related to the subject
of the example and this guide. If you're interested in this level of details,
please look into the code and comments in these files.
</p>    

Here are the directories of interest in the project root:
 * `generated` — this directory contains the code generated by Protobuf Compiler and 
    Spine Model Compiler. This directory and code it contains is created automatically
    when a domain model changes. It is excluded from version control.
 * `gradle` — this directory contains the code of Gradle Wrapper and two Gradle scripts.
    The `idea.gradle` script adds directories with the generated code to the module
    in IntelliJ IDEA. If you use this IDE, you may want look into this code.
    The `test.gradle` adds JUnit dependencies to the project. We chose to extract this code
    into separate files to simplify the code of `build.gradle`.
 * `src` — contains the handcrafted source code.

Let's review the source code structure.

### The `src` directory
The source code directory follows standard Gradle conventions and has two sub-directories:
`main` — for the production code, and `tests`.

The production code consists of two parts allocated by sub-directories:
  * `proto` — contains the definition of data structures in Google Protobuf. 
    The code from this directory is compiled into the `generated` directory described above.
  * `java` — contains the model behavior and other server and client code written in Java.

Now let's review the code in details, starting with how to add Spine to a Gradle project.

## Adding Spine to a Gradle project
Let's open `build.gradle` from the root of the project. The simplest and recommended way for
adding Spine dependencies to a project is the Bootstrap plugin:

<?code-ecerpt "build.gradle (add-plugin)"?>
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'io.spine.tools.gradle.bootstrap' version '1.5.8'
}
```
Once the plugin is added, we can use it features:

<?code-ecerpt "build.gradle (add-server-dependency)"?>
```groovy
spine.enableJava().server()
```
This enables Java in the module and adds necessary dependencies.

<p class="note">Calling `server()` adds both server- and client-side dependencies. This way a module
of a Bounded Context “A” may be a client for a Bounded Context “B”. Client-side applications or
modules should call: `spine.enableJava().client()`.</p>

<p class="lead">To be continued...</p>
