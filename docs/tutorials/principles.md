title: Spine Event Engine Principles
---

In Spine Event Engine a Domain Model, including commands, events and aggregates, is described using Protobufs.
Using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) allows automatic code generation for events and commands on variety of platforms hugely saving development team effort.

### Working with Protocol Buffers

By default Spine Event Engine uses *Protocol Buffers*, Googleâ€™s
mature open source mechanism for serializing structured data (although it
can be used with other data formats such as JSON). You
can find out lots more about Protocol Buffers in the [Protocol Buffers
documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview).

#### Protocol Buffer versions

While Protocol Buffers have been available for open source users for some
time, Spine uses a new flavor of Protocol Buffers called proto3,
which has a slightly simplified syntax, some useful new features, and supports
lots more languages. This is currently available as an beta release in
Java and C++, with an alpha release for JavaNano (Android Java), Python, and
Ruby from [the Protocol Buffers Github
repo](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases), as well as a Go language
generator from [the golang/protobuf Github repo](https://github.com/golang/protobuf), with more languages in development. You can find out more in the [proto3 language guide](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3), and see
the major differences from the current default version in the [release notes](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases). 


### Have typed commands and events
  Json is nice, but having commands and events as first class citizens in the applications gives a lot of benefits in business logic. Not having to convert back-and-forth with Json gives some performance advantage.


### Allow easy extension of commands and events as the app evolves

In some approaches they suggest to have MyEvent_v2, etc. Which is ugly requires adding new handlers, etc.
