# Concepts

<p class="lead">This document provides terminology used in the framework. You'll find most of the
terms familiar from Domain-Driven Design methodology, CQRS, Event Sourcing or Enterprise Integration
patterns. We give brief of each term for those who are new to them and describe how a concept is
implemented in our framework. Terms that we introduce as extensions to the industry-set terminology
are designated as such.</p>
